## 🎯 About The App

Knight Pokémon is a modern web app that fetches Pokémon data from a custom backend connected to PokeAPI.  
It provides a smooth browsing experience with large Pokémon cards, server-driven infinite scrolling, detailed modal views, and favorites management stored in MongoDB.

The application focuses on:

- Clean architecture  
- Reusable hooks  
- Component-driven UI  
- Real-world engineering trade-offs  
- Exceptional UX polish  

Built for **Firefly** as a senior-level demonstration of full-stack proficiency.

## ✨ Features

### Core Requirements

- View the first **150 Pokémon** (hard-capped in the backend)
- Search by name
- View detailed Pokémon info: types, abilities, evolution chain
- Add / remove favorites (persistent via backend)
- Display favorites directly in the list and details views
- Backend communication with React Query

### Bonus Enhancements

- **Server-driven infinite scrolling** using `offset`/`limit` and React Query’s `useInfiniteQuery`
- **Intersection Observer** sentinel for automatic “load more” while scrolling
- **Animated modal transitions** using Framer Motion
- **Clickable evolution chips** that load other Pokémon in place, with animated transitions
- Large card-based UI with hover motion
- “Knight Pokémon” banner and polished theme
- Fully typed TypeScript API + domain models
- Unified API response envelope + robust error handling
- Favorites-only toggle that filters client-side on the loaded dataset

## 🧠 Approach

- **Feature-based architecture** for clarity and scalability  
- **Reusable hooks** encapsulate business logic:
  - `usePokemonList` – server-driven infinite scroll (`offset`/`limit`, `hasNextPage`)
  - `usePokemonDetails` – Pokémon details + evolution chain
  - `useFavoriteActions` – add/remove favorites with backend mutations
  - `useUiState` – selected Pokémon, search term, favorites-only toggle
- **React Query** handles caching, pagination, and invalidation
- **Chakra UI** provides accessible, responsive components
- **Framer Motion** adds micro-interactions and smooth modal transitions
- **Clean Code principles**: separation of concerns, typed boundaries, consistent naming, small composable components

Favorites are **canonical on the backend**:
- Frontend sends only the Pokémon ID when favoriting.
- Backend fetches canonical Pokémon data from PokeAPI and persists it in MongoDB.
- List and details endpoints mark each Pokémon with `isFavorite`, so the UI never has to manually stitch favorites.

---

## 🌟 Bonus Enhancements

- In-place evolution navigation inside the modal  
- Animated detail transitions when switching between Pokémon  
- Server-driven infinite scroll with `useInfiniteQuery` and `hasNextPage`  
- Custom loader, error states, and empty states for better UX  
- Responsive, hover-enhanced card grid  
- Favorites-only view built as a **client-side filter** on the loaded dataset (no unnecessary network calls)

---

## 🚧 Status

Production-ready version for the Firefly assignment.  
Further improvements could include PWA support, offline caching, and advanced search (e.g. by type or ability).
